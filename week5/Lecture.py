Refactoring
    If you have done something in the past and know how to do it it can be stored
    ie. a function like 'cut' has be previously defined therefor can be called
    IDEA: Red, green, refactor
        can write code that passes and gives green
        then, go back to make it nicer and neater and more efficient
        keep going while its still green --> Refactoring
    DRY --> Dont Repeat Yourself
    Shallow indentation is good!

Recursion
    calling a function within itself
    replacement - used alot in comp design in an L system
        recursion and l systems are not the same
        recursion is used in an L system but an L system in not recursion
    
Data Ethics
    Safety: 
    Fairness: 

    Collection: Do you need that information; dont force values; be clear about your intentions
    Storage: dont do storage yourself(use a websystem with pros and security); do you need to store?; be careful with your secrets - phising is a huge issue
    Use: use the data, get the most out of it; be at least twice as paranoid about data security
    Bais: function of your expereince of the world that explains how the world works - means you will believe things that are not true because you havent seen a counter example;
